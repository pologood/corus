      <p>
        Starting with release 5, Corus supports integration with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access">NUMA</a> hardware architecture. 
        NUMA, which stands for "Non Uniform Memory Access", is a design of computer memory on multiprocessor computers which consists of segmenting memory slots into 
        colocated nodes, in order to provide local access to CPU cores. This local affinity of CPU with memory reduces the latency involved in accessing it, and may
        provide a significant increase for memory-bound applications (although each application should be tested, and no wide-ranging positive impact can be assumed).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the highlights of the NUMA integration:
        <ul>
          <li>Automatic discovery of NUMA nodes available on the running server;</li>
          <li>automatic processor and memory assignment;</li>
          <li>automatic load-balancing of process execution among available NUMA nodes;</li>
          <li>possibility of restricting process execution to a NUMA node subset.</li>
        </ul>

    <sapia:sect2 title="Introduction">
    	<p>
          NUMA integration is provided in Corus via the <tt>numactl</tt> command on Linux to manage process policies. When
          this feature is enabled, Corus will start assigning each executed process to the next available NUMA node. The assignment 
          algorithm follows a very simple round-robbin strategy in order to load balance the processes on all the nodes available
          on the machine.
    	</p>
        <sapia:note>
          The current interation can only assign a single NUMA node for each running process.
        </sapia:note>
    </sapia:sect2>
    
    
    <sapia:sect2 title="Node Assignment">
      <p>
        The main functionnality of the NUMA integration is the ability for Corus to perform processor and memory assignation of
        running processes. The assignation is performed in a way to evenly distribute the processes over the available NUMA nodes. This
        load-balancing strategy is made dynamically upon execution of new processes, thus ensuring a deterministic behavior during
        the lifespan of a Corus sevrer runtime.   
      </p>
      
      <sapia:note>
        The usage of the JVM argument <tt>-XX:+UseNUMA</tt> conflicts with the current Corus/NUMA integration as the JVM is overriding
        any policies that could be applied by the <tt>numactl</tt> command. The JVM argument will create segment of memory to spread
        memory accros the NUMA nodes and it will also trigger special GC behavior to minimize cross-node communication. The
        <tt>numactl</tt> command allows for the assignment of processes to a single NUMA node, thus eliminating any cross-node communication and
        leveraging the optimal performance of the host server.<b>Use the best option that applies to you use case, but don't use both</b>.
      </sapia:note>
      
      <p>
        Corus support two modes for defining the inventory of NUMA nodes available for assignment:
        <ul>
          <li>Automatic node discovery, for ease of use;</li>
          <li>manual node definition, for specific needs.</li>
        </ul> 
      </p>
      
      <sapia:sect3 title="Automatic Node Discovery">
        <p>
          Corus provides an automatic discovery mechanism which detects, on startup, the available NUMA nodes on the host. This 
          behavior is activated by the <tt>corus.server.numa.auto-detection.enabled</tt> configuration property. In this mode (which is the default) 
          you have nothing more to do: Corus will automatically pin started processes over the available NUMA nodes.
        </p>
      </sapia:sect3>
      
      <sapia:sect3 title="Manual Node Definition">
        <p>
          For advanced use-cases, Corus supports resticting the NUMA nodes on to load-balance running
          processes. The <tt>corus.server.numa.first.node.id</tt> property defines the lower bound of the NUMA node range to use. 
          By the same token, the <tt>corus.server.numa.node.count</tt> property is also available to define the
          total number of NUMA nodes managed by Corus. These properties dictate the range within which Corus will pin processes to NUMA nodes. 
        </p>
        <sapia:note>Note that any subset defined this way consist of a consecutive list of node ids</sapia:note>
      </sapia:sect3>
    </sapia:sect2>
    

    <sapia:sect2 title="Viewing Node Assignment">
      <p>
        As described above, Corus will assign new processes to NUMA nodes. It two ways to visualize such assignements:
        <ul>
          <li>The <b><tt>ps</tt></b> command of the Corus CLI now provides a <b><tt>-numa</tt></b> option that will list the NUMA node identifier assigned to each process.</li>
          <li>The same information is also available through the <a href="../rest/core.html">REST API</a> using the <tt>get processes</tt> request.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </sapia:sect2>
    
    
    <sapia:sect2 title="Configuration">
   		<p>
   			The behavior of the NUMA integration in Corus is determined by configuration properties in the <tt>corus.properties</tt> file (found under <tt>$CORUS_HOME/config</tt>). The following
   			table lists these properties and provides a description for each:
   		</p>
      
      <sapia:table>
      	<sapia:th>Name</sapia:th>

      			<tt><b>corus.server.numa.enabled</b></tt>

                support this architecture will result in errors when starting processes.

      			This flag enables/disables auto discovery of available NUMA nodes on the running host server (defaults to <tt>true</tt>). If this property is
            set to <tt>false</tt>, the definition of available NUMA nodes must be explicitly set with the appropriate properties (see below).

      			This flag determines the processor assignment policy (defaults to <tt>true</tt>). When set to <tt>true</tt>, Corus will start new
            processes to be executed only on the CPUs of the assigned NUMA node, otherwise the default CPU assignment policy will
            be applied to the process.

            processes with memory allocated only from the assigned NUMA node - note that allocation will fail when there is not enough
            memory available on the node. If the value is set to <tt>false</tt>, then the default memory allocation policy on the host
            will be in effect.

      			Defines the fist NUMA node to use for process binding (defaults to <tt>0</tt>). This value is expected to be an integer that can be changed to restrict
            the first NUMA node from which Corus will start assigning processes (by increasing the lower bound of node range). The value must be greater or equals
            than 0 and lower than the highest NUMA node identifier on the host server (as implied by the "node count", configured with the next property, below).

            when auto-detection is disabled. The value must be an integer greater than 0 and must not exceed the total number
            of NUMA nodes available on the host server.
